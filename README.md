# Probabilistic Model Synthesis

A Python library for probabilistic model synthesis.  Currently, only synthesis of factor analysis (FA) models is implemented. 

## Installation 

1) Currently, this package makes heavy use of the Janelia Core project, and this code should be installed first.  

2) Pytorch also needs to be installed.  Follow the instructions at [https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

3) The probabilistic model synthesis package itself can be installed by running python setup.py from this directory.
